# Open Data Exploration - Getting Started Guide

## Project Overview
This open-ended project allows students to explore data.gov.hk and other open data sources to identify and analyze a policy-relevant question of their choice, with Jupyter notebook support provided for technical analysis.

## Background Context
- **Open-Ended Opportunity**: Students choose their own policy focus area
- **Data Source**: Primarily data.gov.hk but can include other open datasets
- **Technical Support**: Jupyter notebook framework will be provided
- **Policy Relevance**: Must connect to real government decision-making

## Project Selection Criteria
### Policy Relevance
- **Government Decision**: Must relate to actual policy choices or public administration
- **Data Availability**: Sufficient open data must exist for meaningful analysis
- **Impact Potential**: Results should offer actionable insights for policymakers

### Data Requirements
- **Open Access**: Datasets must be publicly available
- **Quality**: Data should be reliable and well-documented
- **Scope**: Sufficient volume and detail for statistical analysis

## Data.gov.hk Exploration Strategy
### Major Categories to Explore
1. **Transport**: Traffic patterns, public transport usage, road safety
2. **Environment**: Air quality, waste management, energy consumption
3. **Health**: Disease surveillance, healthcare utilization, public health indicators
4. **Education**: School performance, enrollment patterns, resource allocation
5. **Housing**: Property prices, public housing, urban development
6. **Economy**: Business licenses, employment, tourism statistics

### Data Quality Assessment
- **Completeness**: Check for missing data and coverage gaps
- **Timeliness**: Ensure data is current and regularly updated
- **Documentation**: Look for metadata and variable definitions
- **Format**: Consider data accessibility and analysis requirements

## Methodology Framework
### Phase 1: Topic Selection and Data Discovery
- Browse data.gov.hk systematically by category
- Identify interesting patterns or policy questions
- Assess data quality and analytical potential
- Narrow focus to specific research question

### Phase 2: Data Analysis and Modeling
- Use provided Jupyter notebook framework
- Conduct exploratory data analysis
- Apply appropriate statistical or machine learning methods
- Validate findings and test robustness

### Phase 3: Policy Insights and Recommendations
- Connect analytical findings to policy implications
- Research relevant government departments and decision processes
- Develop actionable recommendations
- Consider implementation challenges and opportunities

## Technical Tools Provided
### Jupyter Notebook Framework
- **Data Import**: Templates for common data formats
- **Visualization**: Standard plotting and mapping libraries
- **Analysis**: Statistical modeling and machine learning tools
- **Documentation**: Integrated reporting capabilities

### Recommended Approach
- **Start Simple**: Begin with descriptive statistics and basic visualizations
- **Build Complexity**: Gradually add more sophisticated analysis
- **Iterate**: Refine research questions based on initial findings
- **Document**: Maintain clear code comments and analysis notes

## Expected Deliverables
1. **Data Discovery Report**: Documentation of data exploration and topic selection
2. **Technical Analysis**: Jupyter notebook with comprehensive data analysis
3. **Policy Brief**: Translation of findings into policy-relevant insights
4. **Presentation**: Summary of project for class discussion

## Getting Started Steps
1. **Week 1**: Systematic exploration of data.gov.hk categories and datasets
2. **Week 2**: Topic selection and initial data quality assessment
3. **Week 3**: Setup Jupyter environment and begin exploratory analysis
4. **Week 4**: Develop research framework and begin focused analysis

## Topic Selection Examples
